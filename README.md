<P>Short text stream classification suffers from enormous challenges, due to the sparsity, high dimension
and rapid variability of the short text stream. In this paper, we present a short text stream classification
approach refined from online Biterm Topic Model (BTM) using short text expansion and concept
drifting detection. Specifically, in our method, we firstly extend short text streams from an external
resource to make up for the sparsity of data, and use online BTM to select representative topics
instead of the word vector to represent the feature of short texts. Secondly, we propose a concept drift
detection method based on the topic model to detect the hidden concept drifts in short text streams.
Thirdly, we build an ensemble model using several data chunks and update with the newest data chunk
and results of the concept drift detection. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that
compared to well-known baselines, our approach achieves a better performance in the classification
and concept drifting detection.</P>
